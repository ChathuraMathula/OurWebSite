      <p>
        Function is simply a rule that tells how something depends on another thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        As an example you know that the earth rotates around the sun with time. Hence
        The position of the earth depends on time. So we say, the position of the earth
        is a function of time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here, the time <span class="Equations">\((t)\)</span> is called the <b>independant 
        variable</b> 
        and, the position of the earth <span class="Equations">\((P)\)</span> at time 
        <span class="Equations">\((t)\)</span> is the 
        <b>dependant variable</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
          <span>Therefore, we denote</span>
          <p>
            <span class="Equations">$$P\ =\ f(t)$$</span> which is said as <b>&quot;
              <span class="Equations">\(P\)</span> is a function of 
              <span class="Equations">\(t\)</span>&quot;</b>
          </p>
      </p>
        <p>
          You may be not familiar with mathematical notations, but keep in your mind that this tells you that &quot;The <span class="Equations">\(Position(P)\)</span> is a function of <span class="Equations">\(Time(t)\)</span>&quot; or &quot;At <span class="Equations">\(Time(t)\)</span> the position of the earth is denoted by <span class="Equations">\(f(t)\)</span>&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Some people think <span class="Equations">\(f(t)\)</span> means 
          <span class="Equations">\(f\)</span> multiplied by <span class="Equations">\(t\)</span>
           and that is a serious misunderstanding
