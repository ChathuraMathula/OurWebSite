        We will consider a function <span class="Equations">\(y\ =\ f( x)\)</span>.<br>
        Recall that <span class="Equations">\(x\)</span> is the independant variable and 
        <span class="Equations">\(y\)</span> is the dependant variable (because 
        <span class="Equations">\(y\)</span> depends on 
        <span class="Equations">\(x\)</span> such that it satisfies the conditions denoted by 
        <span class="Equations">\(f)\)</span>)

          &#8226; Firstly we will graph these data on an 
          <span class="Equations">\(xy)\)</span> plan. <br>
          (This plane is called the Cartesian Plane in mathematics)<br>
          <span class="Equations">\(x\)</span> - axis shows the

          &#8226; Let's assume our graph looks like this when we graph <span class="Equations">\(x\)</span> against <span class="Equations">\(f(x)\)</span>.

          &#8226; Then we will select a point on the graph to find the gradient of the graph
          at this point. <br>
          (Gradients is also another term that simply tells the ratio of 
          <span class="Equations">\(y\)</span> to <span class="Equations">\(x\)</span>. 
          that is <span class="Equations">\(y/x\)</span>)

          &#8226; Then we take another point as depicted in this illustration and draw a
          straight line through the two points <br>
          &#8226; Next, we find the <span class="Equations">\(slope(=gradient))\)</span> 
          of the straight line as follows.
          (<span class="Equations">\(slope = \delta y/\delta x , \delta \)</span> 
          is used to denote a very small amount) 
        </p>
      </div>
      
      <p>
        $$slope\ =\frac{\ difference\ between\ y\ values}{\ difference\ between\ x\ values}$$
      </p>

      <p>
        $$slope\ =\frac{f( a\ +\ \delta a) \ -\ f( a)}{\ ( a\ +\ \delta a) \ -\ a}$$
      </p>

      <p>
        $$slope\ =\frac{f( a\ +\ \delta a) \ -\ f( a)}{\delta a}$$
      </p>

      <p>
        Let's replace <span class="Equations">\(a\)</span> with 
        <span class="Equations">\(x\)</span>, because <span class="Equations">\(a\)</span> 
        can be any value in the domain <span class="Equations">\(x\)</span>
      </p>

      <p>
        $$slope\ =\frac{\delta y}{\delta x} \ =\frac{f( x\ +\ \delta x) \ -\ f( x)}{\delta x}$$
      </p>

      <p>
        Then we find the limit of the function at both sides when 
        <span class="Equations">\(\delta x\)</span> 
        approaches <span class="Equations">\(0\)</span>
      </p>

      <p>
        $$\lim\limits _{\delta x\rightarrow 0}
          \frac{\delta y}{\delta x} \ =\lim\limits _{\delta x\rightarrow 0}\frac{f( x\ +\ \delta x)
           \ -\ f( x)}{\delta x}$$
      </p>

      <p>
        Lets assume this equals to <span class="Equations">\(L\)</span>,
      </p>

      <p>
        $$\lim\limits _{\delta x\rightarrow 0}\frac{\delta y}{\delta x} \ =L$$
      </p> 

      <p>
        Here, <span class="Equations">
          \(\lim\limits _{\delta x\rightarrow 0}\frac{\delta y}{\delta x} \)</span>
            is called the derivative of the function <span class="Equations">\(f(x)\)</span>
            at point <span class="Equations">\(x\)</span> and is denoted by
            <span class="Equations">$$\frac{dy}{dx}$$</span>
      </p>   
      <p>
        Finding the derivative of a function is called the Differentiation.
      </p>      

      <div id="Figure09" class="border border-info">
        <div>
          <P> ENTER THE CODE FOR FIGURE 9 </P>
        </div>
        <p>
          Slope at point <span class="Equations">\(A = dy/ dx\),</span> 
          which means the derivative of the function at point 
          <span class="Equations">\(A\)</span> 
          is <span class="Equations">\(dy/ dx\)</span>.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>
        Therefore you can see that Differentiation is practically used to find the rate of 
        change of something happans. Such as flow of electricity, rates of change of population
        growth and growth of deceases etc.
