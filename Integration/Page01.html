				Figure 01 shows the graph of \(y = f(x)\) (A function).<br>
				Let's call it a curve.<br><br>
				Then, the Figure 02 shows you <b>the area under the curve</b> <span>\(y = f(x)\)</span> from
				\(a\) to \(b\). (That is from \(x = a\) to \(x = b\))<br>
				Let's call it \(S\). (To denote the Surface Area)
			</div>
			<br>
			<div>
				How we find the area under the curve ?
				<div class="text-center" style="color: red;">Think...!</div>
				<br>
				So, that's why we need mathematical techniques.<br>
				The mathematical technique to find the area under any curve is called the <b>Integration</b>
				<br><br>
				Therefore by using Integration, we could find the area under any curve (any function) if you
				know the function.<br>
				<div class="text-center" style="color:blue;">*To see what is a function, please refer the Introduction to Differentiation of our 
				Differentiation tutorials</div>

				Now we are going to learn the technique used to find the area.

				We cannot find the whole area at once.
				<br>
				Hence, we devides the area under the curve and the \(x\) axis into very thin stripes
				as shown in Figure 03. And then we integrate each stripe's area and get the whole one. That 
				means we take the sum of the every stripe's area.
			</div>
			<br>
			<div>
				Let's consider one stripe as in Figure 04.<br>
				We will let the breadth of this single stripe be \(\delta x\)
				<div class="text-center" style="color:darkblue;">
					(\(\delta x\) means a very small value)
				</div>
				<br>
				You will see that the height of the stripe at that point equals to \(y\).
				<div class="text-center" style="color:darkblue;">
					(Because the value of the function is \(y\) at that point)
				</div>
				<span>So,</span>
				<div><span class="Equations">$$Area\ of\ the\ single\ stripe\ =\ y\ \times \delta x$$
					<span class="Equations">$$s =\ y\ \delta x$$</span> 
				</div>
				<br>
				Therefore, the area under the curve is the sum of areas of all thin Stipes.<br>
				So,
				<div class="text-center">
					Area under the curve\((S)\) = Sum of all areas of thin stripes</div>
				<span class="Equations">$$S\ =\ s_{1} \ +\ s_{2} \ +\ s_{3} +...+\ \ s_{n}$$</span>
				<span>We can write it in mathematical notation as follows</span>
				<span class="Equations">$$S\ =\sum _{i\ =\ 1}^{n} s_{i}$$</span>

				<div class="text-center" style="color:darkblue;">
					This is said as <q>\(S\) equals the sum of all \(s_{1}\) to \(s_{n}\)</q><br>
					{\(\sum\) is the notation used to denote the sum of values and it is called Sigma}
				</div>
				<span>Hence,</span>
				<span class="Equations">$$S\ =\sum y\ \delta x$$</span>

				<div>
					If we let this \(\delta x\) be very small, we can take it as\(dx\).<br>
					Then we use the notation \(\int\) which is a stylized version of the letter 'S' 
					to denote the <b>Sum</b> instead of \(\sum\)
				</div>
				<br>
				<div class="text-center">
					Now, the area under the curve \(y\) and \(x - axis\) is called the <br><b>Integral of the 
					function with respect to \(x\).</b>

					You know that the differentiation (or finding the derivative of a function) gives the rate of
